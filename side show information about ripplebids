The Marketplace of the Future.
The Future of 
Buying & Selling is 
Here.
 Everything great about Amazon & eBay revolutionized like never before.
Before we talk Ripple Bids..
 Who is Ripple & What is XRP?
 Ripple Labs, Inc., founded in 2012 and based in San Francisco, is a technology company specializing in 
enterprise blockchain solutions for global payments, leveraging the XRP Ledger and its native 
cryptocurrency, XRP. Ripple aims to enable faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border transactions, 
positioning itself as an alternative to traditional financial systems like SWIFT.
 Ripple provides digital asset infrastructure for financial institutions, businesses, and governments, focusing 
on: CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS, DIGITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT, STABLECOIN DEVELOPMENT, & 
CENTRAL BANK DIGITAL CURRENCIES 
The Problems with Amazon:
 ● High seller fees.
 ● Subscription costs.
 ● Centralized control & lack of transparency.
 ● Currency conversion & cross-border issues.
 ● Restricted payment options.
 ● Counterfeit & trust issues.
 ● Bad customer service.
The Problems with eBay:
 ● High transaction fees.
 ● Slow & expensive cross-border payments.
 ● Fraud & dispute risks.
 ● Limited accessibility for ‘unbanked’ users.
 ● Complex fee structures.
 ● Currency fluctuations.
 ● Unexciting user interface.
Solving 
Amazon’s 
Problems:
 ● Reduce fees by leveraging blockchain for direct 
transactions. 
● Smart contracts to automate payments, minimizing 
overhead and lowering costs for sellers.
 ● Transparent transaction records ensure verified 
payments and terms. 
● Give sellers and buyers more control, reducing 
platform bias and favoritism.
 ● Cross-border payments without currency conversion in 
less than 5 seconds for fees near $0.01
 ● Enabling the unbanked or crypto users to participate 
without relying on banking infrastructure.
 ● Blockchain-based product tracking to verify 
authenticity. Smart contracts to release funds only 
when delivery is confirmed.
Solving 
eBay’s 
Problems:
 ● Low transaction fees and payment system reduces 
the need for costly middlemen like PayPal or credit 
card processors.
 ● Fast settlement and minimal fees streamline 
cross-border trade, enabling instant payments 
regardless of location.
 ● Blockchain’s transparency ensures all transaction 
details are auditable, reducing fraud and disputes.
 ● Wallets are accessible via smartphones, enabling 
unbanked users to participate in the marketplace 
using crypto.
 ● Simplifies pricing and eliminates exchange rate risks, 
as all transactions occur in a single, stable 
cryptocurrency, reducing complexity for global sellers.
Additional 
Benefits:
 ● Unlike Amazon and eBay’s centralized 
review systems, a blockchain-based 
marketplace could use decentralized 
identity and reputation scores, reducing 
fake reviews and ensuring fairer 
seller/buyer evaluations.
 ● Data Privacy: Traditional platforms 
collect extensive user data, often used 
for advertising. A crypto marketplace 
could prioritize privacy, with transactions 
on the XRP Ledger.
 ● Global Inclusivity: By removing fiat and 
banking barriers, the marketplace can 
attract users from underserved regions, 
fostering a truly global economy.
Example of How it works
 Seller lists an item for 50 
XRP, Buyer (with XRP in 
their wallet) clicks “Buy” 
and connects via Xaman 
Wallet.
 Our site generates a 
transaction, Buyer 
approves it in their wallet; 
XRP ledger processes it 
in ~3 seconds.
 Our site confirms the 
payment and notifies the 
seller to ship. Once delivery is 
confirmed, escrow releases 
funds to seller. 
How would we profit from this?
 ● With transaction fees through the XRP Ledger being so cheap, we plan on 
making our profitability come from two different sources. The main source 
being the implementation of “processing fees” while also offering 
advanced seller memberships.
 ● Processing Fee: 1.5-3.5% for every transaction (buys and sells)
 ● Seller Membership: $25-$50 per month to give our sellers credibility and 
verify identities to avoid quick sell scams. 
XRPB Token
 ● Provides utility and liquidity inside and outside of the marketplace.
 ● Total Supply: 3 billion
 ● Public Ecosystem: 35%
 ● Community/Affiliate Fund: 10%
 ● Reserve: 13%
 ● Liquidity Pool: 10%
 ● Board Holdings: 32% (8-14 month vesting)
 ○ CEO - 10%
 ○ ALL other executives - 5.5% each
 Pre-Sale will be limited to 500 million XRPB = 100k XRP (1 XRP = 5,000 XRPB)
The Company “Account”
 ● A secure multi-signature wallet where entire board must agree to withdraw 
funds. This ensures absolute consensus before moving funds out for any 
reason.
 ● We will have a master issuer wallet holding all of the funds. Each board 
member will then have their own wallet that is added as a signer.
 ● All board members are assigned equal weights and the signer quorum is 
set to 5 to ensure all members are in agreement.
 ● The Xaman app is used for approvals and the XRPL Labs Tools 
(xrptoolkit.com) are used for setting signer lists.
 ● Optional escape hatch can be added for ⅘ agreement in emergencies.

Is the XRP Ledger centralized or decentralized?
 • The XRP Ledger is decentralized, with over 150 validators globally, and no single entity 
(including Ripple) controls it. Changes to the protocol require 80% network consensus, though 
Ripple’s influence (e.g., running some validators) raises questions.
 How secure is XRP and the XRP Ledger for marketplace transactions?
 Common 
Questions 
+ Q&A
 •  XRPL uses cryptographic signing for transactions and a consensus protocol (RPCA) 
that’s resistant to double-spending. Hardware wallets like Ledger enhance security by storing 
private keys offline. However, users must beware of phishing or dusting attacks.
 Do I need a destination tag for transactions in an XRPL marketplace?
 •  These are typically required when sending XRP to custodial wallets (e.g., exchanges like 
Binance) to identify the recipient but typically not needed for personal XRPL wallets or 
marketplace transactions unless specified otherwise.
 How can I store XRP securely for marketplace use?
 •  Questions about storage are frequent. XRP can be stored in hardware wallets (e.g., 
Ledger Nano), software wallets (e.g., Toast Wallet), or XRPL-compatible wallets like Xaman. 
Keeping private keys secure is critical to avoid losing access to funds. Xaman is highly 
recommended for mobile friendly.
